## Development

The project is a single-file HTML application with embedded CSS and JavaScript for simplicity and ease of deployment.

### To modify content:
1. Edit the `data-fr` and `data-en` attributes in the HTML for multi-language text
2. Update the corresponding text content in the JavaScript `translations` object

### To modify styling:
1. CSS custom properties are defined in the `:root` selector for easy theming
2. Component-specific styles are organized by section with comments

### To modify functionality:
1. JavaScript is organized into logical functions
2. Main initialization happens in the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener
3. Scroll events handle parallax and animation triggers

## Performance

- Zero external dependencies for optimal loading
- CSS animations use GPU-accelerated transforms
- JavaScript uses passive event listeners for smooth scrolling
- Minimal and optimized code
